## Relative Clause

- <strong>One</strong> sentence only can have <strong>one</strong> verb.
- Relative Clause combines <strong>2 and more</strong> sentences together.

<pre>
<strong>Example : </strong>
Normal : Yinnie have a pencil. The pencil is very good.
Relative Clause : Yinnie has a pencil which is very good.
</pre>

### Interesting right ?! 

You can combine any sentances only if they have a same noun.

1. People
<pre>
- I met a woman <strong>who has the longest hair in the world</strong>.
- People <strong>who don't want to go to shopping mall</strong> usually are bad people. 
- She is the person <strong>whom I love</strong>.
</pre>

2. Place
<pre>
- I want to be in a place <strong>where I can eat burgers</strong>.
- The USA <strong>where dreams are made from</strong> is the best country in North America.
</pre>

3. Object
<pre>
- Do not eat the orange <strong>which is already expired</strong>
- Can you help me bring the phone <strong>which is sitting on the desk</strong> ?
</pre>

<strong>You can use "that" to replace "who", "where", "which" and all the rest as well !!!</strong>

________________________________

#### A shorter form of Relative Clause

We can skip the words "who", "which", "where" by using <strong>V + ing</strong> or <strong>V3</strong>

1. V + ing
<pre>
Normal Sentences : We are talking about the person. The person runs a business.
Relative Clause 1 : We are talking about the person <strong>who runs a business</strong>.
Relative Clause 2 : We are talking about the person <strong>running a business</strong>.
</pre>

2. V3
: Use when we connect the sentence with Passive Voice.
<pre>
Normal Sentences : You ate an orange. The orange was expired a week ago.
Relative Clause 1 : You ate an orange <strong>that was expired a week ago</strong>.
Relative Clause 2 : You ate an orange <strong>expired a week ago</strong>.
</pre>
